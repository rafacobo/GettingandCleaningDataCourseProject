========================================================

This explains how <code>run_analysis.R</code> perform the required tasks. Also I have try to write the code in a easy to read way.

## Initial Set Up
First of all you need to download the data, unzip, and set the R working folder where "UCI HAR Dataset" is located. This part is commented on the <code>run_analysis.R</code> code

## Process
<code>run_analysis.R</code> load different datasets names some columns.
After merging in a concrete way it perform mean a sd calculations.

## Tidy set
Last, but not least, <code>run_analysis.R</code> creates a tidy set that have to be uploaded

## Requirements
<code>run_analysis.R</code> needs reshape2 package
